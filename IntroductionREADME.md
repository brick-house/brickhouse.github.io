## About Me

I am passionate about full-stack development and entrepreneurial ventures. I thrive on overcoming challenges, whether it's creating cutting-edge applications or launching new businesses. Thank you for recognizing my experience and abilities.

During the pandemic, I made a transition from a start-up endeavor to the cruise ship travel industry. As a Group Cruise Specialist, I sharpen my critical thinking and problem-solving skills daily, which has been valuable in my MIT xPRO boot camp program.

Despite my background in administrative support roles for the past 20 years, I am exhilarated to fully immerse myself in the world of new technologies and tools. I firmly believe that diversity is essential for driving innovation, and I am eager to join a team that values and embraces our differences. By bringing together diverse perspectives and experiences, we can create groundbreaking solutions that have a positive impact on society.

I am enthusiastic about collaborating with others and working towards achieving remarkable results in the tech industry. With my MERN certification from MIT xPRO expected in Spring 2024, I am ready to contribute my skills and passion to make magic happen. Let's accomplish great things together!

I enrolled in the Professional Certificate in Coding: For Women in March 2023 and will be certified as a full-stack developer by Spring 2024. I am thrilled to explore various opportunities in this field. My entrepreneurial spirit drives me to collaborate with like-minded individuals to turn ideas into reality and provide tangible solutions.

## Skills

I have a versatile and well-rounded set of developer skills that are increasing daily, which include the following:

- Languages: JavaScript, JSON
- Front-End: HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
- Frameworks and Libraries: Bootstrap and a
  Animation CSS
- Back-End: Node.js and Mern-stack
- Databases: MySQL
- Tools: Git, VSCode, APIs, Jest
- Soft skills: Teamwork, Communication, Problem-
  solving, and Critical-thinking
